# üìò Ceph Storage Overview

## üîç What Is Ceph?

**Ceph** is an open-source, software-defined storage platform that provides unified support for:
- **Object Storage** (via RADOS Gateway)
- **Block Storage** (via RBD)
- **File Storage** (via CephFS)

It‚Äôs designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility across commodity hardware.

| Component     | Role                                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **MON**       | Monitors cluster health and consensus     |
| **OSD**       | Manages data storage on physical disks    |
| **MGR**       | Provides monitoring and dashboard services|
| **MDS**       | Handles metadata for CephFS               |
| **RGW**       | S3-compatible object gateway              |

## üß† CephFS vs ext4

| Feature             | CephFS                            | ext4                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Type                | Distributed file system           | Local file system             |
| Scalability         | Multi-node, petabyte-scale        | Single-node only              |
| Redundancy          | Built-in replication              | Manual setup required         |
| Access              | Network mountable (POSIX)         | Local only                    |
| Metadata            | Stored in RADOS pools             | Stored in inode tables        |

## üíæ Using Ceph for Docker & Python

- **Docker**:
  - Store images on CephFS or RBD volumes
  - Use as shared cache or persistent volume in Kubernetes

- **Python**:
  - Host virtual environments on CephFS
  - Share packages across compute nodes

---

## ü™ü CephFS on Windows

### Access Methods:
- **Native (Ceph-Dokan)**: Requires Dokan driver and Ceph installer
- **SMB Gateway**: Re-export CephFS via Samba from Ubuntu

### Windows 11 Support:
- Works with Dokan (Secure Boot must be disabled)
- Limited ACL and locking support
