Personally, I\u2019ve encountered conflict only a few times\u2014two or three at most\u2014but through countless discussions and observations, one key insight stands out: a pervasive lack of communication. This issue isn\u2019t just confined to leaders; it exists at all levels within companies. When communication breaks down, objectives become unclear, priorities are misaligned, and collaboration suffers. At its core, conflict often arises because people aren\u2019t on the same page. Yet, the shared goal should always be simple: doing what\u2019s best for the organization as a whole. I share this because I truly believe that fostering clear and open communication is crucial to overcoming conflicts and building a more harmonious, effective workplace.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>WSJF is a prioritization method that would avoid lot of conflicts !
