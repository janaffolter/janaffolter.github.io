This is one of the most important aspects in my opinion.</p> <p>My main role is to coordinate these efforts to ensure that the product is delivered on time, within budget, and with all the features requested by the client.

Working with multicultural and dispersed teams around the world adds an extra challenge that I successfully tackle.</p> <p>As a leader, I lead by example and empower teams and individuals. My expertise lies in work definition, organization, prioritization, and follow-up. I value communication and collaboration, but I also make timely decisions. Conflicts<sup>2</sup> are rare and minor because important decisions are discussed between all parties, always prioritizing<sup>3</sup> company interests over individual interests.</p> <p>I leverage my experience as a customer and service provider to anticipate customer\u2019s expectations. By actively listening to all stakeholders, I optimize development processes, avoiding unnecessary rework and enabling seamless integration of future enhancements. This approach results in cost savings, improved stability, and faster time-to-market. I also consider external and internal needs, balancing product value with technical debt.</p> <p>While my direct involvement in development has decreased, I understand technical aspects strongly.
