Personally, I\u2019ve encountered conflict only a few times\u2014two or three at most\u2014but through countless discussions and observations, one key insight stands out: a pervasive lack of communication. This issue isn\u2019t just confined to leaders; it exists at all levels within companies. When communication breaks down, objectives become unclear, priorities are misaligned, and collaboration suffers. At its core, conflict often arises because people aren\u2019t on the same page. Yet, the shared goal should always be simple: doing what\u2019s best for the organization as a whole. I share this because I truly believe that fostering clear and open communication is crucial to overcoming conflicts and building a more harmonious, effective workplace.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>WSJF is a prioritization method that would avoid lot of conflicts !

These maps are always current, reflecting any changes in the IT landscape<sup>1</sup>-<sup>3</sup>-<sup>4</sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p>MID Server: Discovery is performed by a MID Server, an agent installed within your network that communicates securely with ServiceNow in the cloud.

I am writing to bring attention to a pressing issue regarding the age-based contribution rates of the LPP (2nd pillar) pension scheme in Switzerland and to explain why this practice constitutes discrimination against human rights laws.</p> <p>The current structure of the LPP contribution rates increases progressively with the age of the employee. While this system aims to ensure adequate savings for retirement, it inadvertently results in age discrimination against senior employees, particularly those aged 50 and above. This age-based contribution structure violates the principles of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in various human rights laws and international agreements, including:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Swiss Federal Constitution Article 8 of the Swiss Federal Constitution guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination based on age. By imposing higher contribution rates on senior employees, the LPP system creates an unequal financial burden solely based on age, undermining the constitutional right to equality.</p> </li> <li> <p>The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) Article 14 of the ECHR prohibits discrimination on various grounds, including age. The current LPP contribution rates disproportionately affect senior employees, placing them at a disadvantage compared to their younger counterparts. This practice is inconsistent with the ECHR's mandate to promote equal treatment for all individuals, regardless of age.</p> </li> <li> <p>International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions Switzerland, as a member of the ILO, is bound by its conventions, including Convention No. 111, which aims to eliminate discrimination in employment and occupation. The age-based LPP contribution rates effectively discriminate against senior employees, contravening the ILO's principles of equal opportunity and treatment.</p> </li> <li> <p>The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) Article 7 of the UDHR states that all individuals are entitled to equal protection against discrimination. The LPP's age-based contribution structure fails to uphold this fundamental human right, as it imposes a higher financial burden on employees solely based on their age.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Economic and Social Impact Age discrimination in the LPP contribution rates not only violates human rights laws but also has significant economic and social implications. Senior employees face increased financial pressure, potentially leading to reduced disposable income and financial insecurity. This can result in decreased productivity, lower morale, and a negative impact on the overall well-being of senior employees.</p> <p>Call to Action I urge the relevant authorities to review and reform the LPP contribution structure to ensure it aligns with the principles of equality and non-discrimination. By adopting a more equitable system, Switzerland can uphold its commitment to human rights and foster an inclusive and fair working environment for all employees, regardless of age.</p> <p>Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

In 2023, Switzerland\u2019s M2 growth fell by 10.4% year-on-year-a rare and significant contraction. As of early 2025, M2 remains below its 2020 peak and has even declined slightly month-on-month. This persistent drop signals tight monetary conditions, which can suppress lending, investment, and consumption.</p>"},{"location":"Studies/SNBPlaysforSurvivalNotProsperity/#potential-solution-moderately-expanding-m2","title":"Potential Solution: Moderately Expanding M2","text":"<p>1. Easing Monetary Policy Further The SNB has already started lowering policy rates (now at 0.25%), but further targeted easing could encourage banks to lend more, businesses to invest, and households to spend. A moderate, well-communicated increase in M2 would help reverse the current contraction, supporting domestic demand and business confidence.</p> <p>2. Supporting Credit Growth With loans to the private sector only growing modestly, policies that incentivize banks to lend-such as reducing reserve requirements or offering targeted lending facilities-could help channel more money into productive sectors.</p> <p>3. Balancing Risks The SNB must avoid overstimulating the economy, which could reignite inflation or asset bubbles. Careful monitoring and gradual adjustments are essential.</p>"},{"location":"Studies/SNBPlaysforSurvivalNotProsperity/#expected-benefits","title":"Expected Benefits","text":"<ul> <li>Boosting Domestic Demand: More money in circulation typically leads to higher consumption and investment, countering the drag from weak foreign trade.</li> <li>Stimulating Growth: A reversal in M2 contraction could help lift GDP growth closer to its historical average, creating jobs and improving wage prospects.</li> <li>Restoring Confidence: Clear signals from the SNB about supporting growth can improve business and consumer sentiment, encouraging forward-looking investments.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Studies/SNBPlaysforSurvivalNotProsperity/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Switzerland\u2019s current M2 contraction reflects a policy of caution, but it is holding back the economy\u2019s potential. By moderately expanding M2, the SNB can help transition from mere survival to renewed prosperity-revitalizing domestic demand, supporting growth, and restoring confidence in Swiss economic dynamism. For Switzerland to move beyond economic decadence, a bold, balanced approach to M2 policy may be the key to unlocking a new era of prosperity.</p>"},{"location":"Studies/SNBPlaysforSurvivalNotProsperity/#references","title":"References","text":"<ol> <li>CEIC</li> <li>Swiss National Bank (SNB)</li> <li>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</li> <li>sciencedirect - Analysing the impact of money supply on economic growth</li> <li>Investopedia - What is inflation?</li> <li>Investopedia - What is M2?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/avantis-investigation/","title":"2025-09-16 - $AVNT","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/bellarium-investigation/","title":"2025-08-21 - $BEL","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/bfx-investigation/","title":"2025-10-03 - $BFX","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/bitcoin-hyper-investigation/","title":"2025-08-21 - $HYPER","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/bluwhale_bluai_investigation_report/","title":"2025-10-26 - $BLUAI","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/chainopera-ai-coai-investigation-report/","title":"2025-10-27 - $COAI","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/elderglade-forensic-report/","title":"2025-08-21 - $ELDE","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/maxi-doge-investigation/","title":"2025-08-21 - $MAXI","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/pepepawn-investigation/","title":"2025-08-21 - $PEPA","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/subbd-investigation/","title":"2025-08-21 - $SUBBD","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/token6900-investigation/","title":"2025-08-21 - $T6900","text":""},{"location":"Studies/CryptoICO/turtle-investigation-report/","title":"2025-10-27 - $TURTLE","text":""}]}
