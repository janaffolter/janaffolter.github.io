My expertise lies in work definition, organization, prioritization, and follow-up. I value communication and collaboration, but I also make timely decisions. </p> <p>I leverage my experience as a customer and service provider to anticipate customer\u2019s expectations. By actively listening to all stakeholders, I optimize development processes, avoiding unnecessary rework and enabling seamless integration of future enhancements. This approach results in cost savings, improved stability, and faster time-to-market. I also consider external and internal needs, balancing product value with technical debt.</p> <p>While my direct involvement in development has decreased, I understand technical aspects strongly. I provide advice (sometimes after thorough explanations) to address challenges. My focus lies in the global solution, ensuring consistency, preventing duplicate work we can see in large teams, and emphasizing development, optimization, security, and especially automation.</p> <p>As a leader, I lead by example and I empower teams and individuals. My expertise lies in work definition, organization, prioritization and follow up. I value communication and collaboration, but I also make timely decisions. Conflicts<sup>1</sup> are rare and minor because important decisions are discussed between all parties, always prioritizing<sup>2</sup> company interests over individual interests.</p> <p>About my personality</p> <p>My personality is Assertive Campaigner (ENFP-A). Read more about my personality profile.</p> <ol> <li> <p>I mention this because I'm often asked this question about conflict management. It seems to be a big problem in companies, but throughout my career it's only happened to me two or three times at most. It seems that the main problem is that the objective isn't clearly identified, and the objective is always what's best for the company you're working for.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>WSJF is a prioritization method that would avoid lot of conflicts !
